# iNeuron Projrct - Fraud_Transcation_Detection

## Project Description
> Credit card frauds are easy and friendly targets. E-commerce and many other online sites have increased the online payment modes, increasing the risk for online frauds. Increase in fraud rates, researchers started using different machine learning methods to detect and analyse frauds in online transactions. The main aim of the paper is to design and develop a novel fraud detection method for Transaction Data, with an objective, to analyse the past transaction details of the customers and extract the behavioural patterns.
